I am a first-year year PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/index.php), College of William & Mary. My research concentration is in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Social Media Mining, and Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in studying state-of-the-art learning methods, and applying them to solve real world problems.

Before starting at W&M, I worked as a graduate research assistant and completed my MS degree in Computer Science at the University of Rochester. Specifically, I worked on building neural-symbolic semantic parsing systems and automating natural language infrence with [Lenhart Schubert](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~schubert/). I was also involved in [VISTA Lab](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/#VISTA)'s COVID-19 projects for studying the impacts of the pandemic from different angles using data collected from social media networks.
